# Pokebowl

Pokemon is celebrating their 20 year anniversary this year with a Superbowl commercial. In that spirit I decided to make my submission an homage.
But how does this answer the JVM challenge? A football game is just a series of plays. If we could predict the outcome of each play, the culmination would naturally predict the outcome of the game. So then imagine a football game as a turn based game where the coach calls plays and the outcome is calculated from the team's stats. This submission is meant to simulate a football game by using the 2015 regular season stats of both teams to calculate the outcome of each play. I don't know anything about sports statistics so I have no idea if this is a valid exercise.

*Note: This was time consuming so offense can only do screen passes, punts, or field goals and defense can only do zone coverage. Also, the backend calculations to simulate the outcome of each play are rudimentary at best. Early-release-pre-alpha-prototype
